# Taxonomic_-_BGC_Diversity
Microbial communities play a vital role in ecosystem function and stability, with natural products, which are specialized metabolites produced by organisms, being key to many of their interactions. These compounds are often encoded within biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) belonging to a gene cluster family (GCF), which have become a major focus in natural product discovery. Leveraging developments in metagenomics and genome mining, this project investigates the relationship between taxonomic diversity and biosynthetic diversity across different biomes using publicly available datasets from MGnify and the BGC Atlas.
