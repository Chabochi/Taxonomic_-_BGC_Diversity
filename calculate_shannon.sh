# Script to calculate Shannon-Wiener diversity index per sample based on GCF (Gene Cluster Family) assignments.
#
# This script reads a tab-separated taxonomy file (`regions_taxonomy.tsv`) and computes
# the Shannon-Wiener diversity index for each sample (assembly) based on the frequency
# of `bigslice_gcf_id` values (assumed to be in column 14).
#
# Behavior:
# - Counts occurrences of each `gcf_id` per sample.
# - Calculates relative abundance and applies the Shannon formula:
#     H = -âˆ‘ p_i * log(p_i)
# - Special case: if `gcf_id == -1`, the calculation assumes a probability of 1/total.
#
# Input:
#   - `regions_taxonomy.tsv`: TSV with sample IDs in column 2 and GCF IDs in column 14.
#
# Output:
#   - `sample_gcf_shannon.tsv`: TSV file with two columns: sample ID and Shannon index.
#
# Example Output Format:
#   SAMPLE_001    2.484921
#   SAMPLE_002    3.157298
#
# Requirements:
#   - `awk` (with support for `log` function, typically GNU awk)
#
# Usage:
#   ./calculate_shannon.sh
